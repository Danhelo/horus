# The Primitive: Neural Surgery

## The Question

What is the atomic unit of interaction in HORUS?

Not "click a button." Not "type a prompt." Something more fundamental—the irreducible gesture from which all other interactions compose.

## The Answer: Neural Surgery

The primitive is **the specific operation a user performs on the feature graph**.

This is deliberate framing. Not "editing" (too passive). Not "controlling" (too mechanical). _Surgery_—precise, intentional, consequential manipulation of a living system.

Each surgery is:

- **Targeted** — affects specific features or regions
- **Graded** — has intensity/magnitude
- **Reversible** — can be undone, experimented with
- **Composable** — combines with other surgeries

## The Toolkit

Users need a vocabulary of surgical operations. Here's the initial set:

### 1. **ILLUMINATE**

Highlight a feature or region. See what's active. Pure observation—but observation that changes what you notice next.

_Gesture:_ Hover, select, focus
_Effect:_ Visual emphasis, information surfacing

### 2. **AMPLIFY / ATTENUATE**

Turn a feature up or down. The core steering operation.

_Gesture:_ Dial, slider, scroll on selection
_Effect:_ Feature strength changes, generation shifts

### 3. **NAVIGATE**

Move through the graph. Change your vantage point in ideaspace.

_Gesture:_ Pan, zoom, rotate, teleport
_Effect:_ Different features enter/exit view

### 4. **ZOOM (Semantic)**

Change abstraction level. Zoom in = more granular features. Zoom out = higher-level concepts.

_Gesture:_ Scroll, pinch
_Effect:_ Hierarchy expands/collapses, detail level shifts

### 5. **PIN**

Lock a feature's value. It stays constant while you manipulate others.

_Gesture:_ Click to pin, click again to release
_Effect:_ Constraint on steering—explore variations with one thing held constant

### 6. **TRACE**

Follow a path through feature space. See the trajectory of a text or a generation.

_Gesture:_ Scrub timeline, animate path
_Effect:_ Temporal structure revealed

### 7. **BLEND**

Interpolate between two states. Morph from one feature configuration to another.

_Gesture:_ Drag between two points, slider between two snapshots
_Effect:_ Smooth transition, intermediate states generated

### 8. **SNAPSHOT**

Save the current state. A point in the space you can return to or compare against.

_Gesture:_ Save button, named bookmark
_Effect:_ State preserved for later

### 9. **DIFF**

Compare two states. What features differ? By how much?

_Gesture:_ Select two snapshots, enter diff view
_Effect:_ Divergence visualized

### 10. **QUERY** (Advanced)

Ask the LLM to find or construct a region of ideaspace.

_Gesture:_ Natural language input
_Effect:_ Graph navigates to semantic target, relevant features highlighted

## Composability

The power is in combination:

- **ILLUMINATE + AMPLIFY** = "What happens if I boost what's already active?"
- **PIN + NAVIGATE** = "Hold creativity constant, explore different topics"
- **TRACE + DIFF** = "How did this text's journey differ from that one's?"
- **QUERY + ZOOM** = "Take me to 'melancholy', then show me its constituents"

This is the combinatorial explosion. N primitives → N² combinations → emergent interactions we didn't design.

---

## What We Don't Know Yet

### How constrained should combinations be?

- **Open:** Any primitive composes with any other. Maximum emergence, risk of chaos.
- **Constrained:** Certain combinations are privileged or guided. Cleaner, but less discovery.
- **Hybrid:** A "grammar" that suggests valid compositions without forbidding others.

### How do we surface composability?

- Explicit UI showing "you can combine these"?
- Emergent discovery through play?
- Tutorials/examples that demonstrate combinations?

### How does this extend?

- Can users define new primitives?
- Can primitives be shared as "tools" others can use?
- Are there "macros"—saved sequences of operations?

---

## The Meta Question

Eventually, the primitive layer itself becomes programmable:

- **Feature-level apps:** A "tone adjuster" app is just ILLUMINATE + AMPLIFY on tone-related features, packaged with a nice UI.
- **LLM-assisted surgery:** "Make this more playful" → the system translates intent into a sequence of operations.
- **Cross-model surgery:** Operations that affect one model's features trigger changes in another's.

The surgical toolkit is the foundation. What gets built on it is unbounded.

_The hand moves. The graph shifts. The text transforms. Neural surgery as creative act._
