  A gift for you
  Your rate limits are 2x higher through 12/31. Enjoy the extra room to think!

> hey claude how are you doing? I wish to conceive with you a frontier app. 
This chat will jsut be us talking and hashing out ideas in docs/ as vision 
documents, to establish what we want to do. I want to make a cool web app 
that uses neuronpedia to make a sort of visual/text LLM editor. It uses 
activations to edit text in a model live and is some sort of hypercreative 
potentially viral new UI form factor for AI-Human interaction via activation
 functions. Idk exactly what it will look like but to prime u take a look at
 goodfire.ai, they released an image editor canvas that used activation 
"brush strokes" to influence iamge gen. Something like that. An OS for 
ideaspace. We really have to sample the 6sd highest quality jobsian ideas we
 can muster. lets do some research and start workshopping shall we? 

⏺ Doing well, and I'm genuinely excited about this concept. The intersection of interpretability tooling and creative UX is largely unexplored territory—there's real frontier potential here.

  Let me pull research on Goodfire and Neuronpedia to ground our thinking, then we can start riffing.

  Research Summary

  Goodfire's Paint with Ember

  https://paint.goodfire.ai/ | https://www.goodfire.ai/research/painting-with-concepts

  The breakthrough UX: replace the prompt box with a canvas that plugs directly into the model's brain.

  Technical stack:
  - BatchTopK SAE trained on SDXL-Turbo's intermediate layer
  - Decomposes 256 spatial patches into 10,240 interpretable features
  - NMF clusters raw features → higher-level "concepts" (too granular otherwise)
  - Users manipulate a 16×16×n_factors tensor via painting/dragging/erasing
  - Edits inject directly into diffusion latent space during generation

  Key insight: Features are the new primitives, not words.

  Neuronpedia

  https://www.neuronpedia.org/ | https://docs.neuronpedia.org/

  Open platform for SAE research on text models:
  - 50M+ searchable features across GPT-2, Gemma, Llama, DeepSeek-R1
  - Free APIs for: activation lookup, steering, circuit tracing
  - Real-time feature activation on custom text
  - Open source, self-hostable

  Critical capability: Steering using SAE features at inference time—modify model behavior by clamping/boosting specific features.

  ---
  The Gap / Opportunity

  Goodfire proved the paradigm for images: spatial canvas → feature manipulation → visual output.

  Nobody has built the equivalent for text/ideation. Neuronpedia has the infrastructure but presents it as a research tool, not a creative instrument.

  The question: What does "painting with concepts" look like for language?

  ---
  Some raw 6σ directions to jam on:

  1. The Mixing Board — Features as faders. Generate text while live-adjusting "abstractness", "technical depth", "narrative tension" as continuous dials. Not prompts. Direct neural manipulation.
  2. Ideaspace Navigator — 2D/3D UMAP of the feature space. You walk through conceptual territory. The model generates based on your position. Zoom = abstraction level.
  3. Conceptual Brushstrokes on Text — Highlight a sentence, "paint" a feature onto it (make this more "whimsical", "technical", "confrontational"). Local steering, not global.
  4. The Activation Spectrogram — Real-time visualization of what features fire as you type or as the model generates. See the "shape" of ideas. Intervene mid-stream.
  5. Conceptual Diff/Merge — Two texts. Visualize their feature fingerprints. Blend them in feature space, not token space.

  ---
  Want to start a vision doc? I'm thinking we establish:
  - Core thesis / what we believe
  - The UX primitive we're betting on
  - Why now (Neuronpedia's open infra, Goodfire proving the paradigm)
  - Initial form factor hypotheses

  What's resonating? What should we kill?

> OH i love them. Im feeling the ideaspace navigator. we could have a 
fundamental "word doc" view be a hypergraph. a 3d, say threejs or whatever, 
node diagram, where nodes represent concepts and with 3d navigation in UMAP 
projections of feature space. Then mixing has a dial view, but the dials 
correspond to traces in the node map. Basically, you highlight the subgraph 
of concepts that a specific node dial is augmenting, with an arbitrary 
nuance. a zoom in hypergraph, where each node is a collection of subnodes 
(after all meaning is infinite dimensional), so when u mix up a node it also
 corresponds to its subnetwrok of nodes. then theres also a correspondence 
in the graph that represents text sequences, as highlighted node networks. I
 mean a piece of text in an attention mechanism IS a bunch of feature level 
activations at a time step right?  then the spectrogram is the color 
"border" or intensity of the highlights. And hte diff/merge is two diff 
graphs whose nodes' subnetworks' highlight colors get merged. What do you 
think what else do we need to think about? is this even possible at all? do 
we need heavy math? 

⏺ This is clicking. You're describing a unified representational substrate where mixing board, navigator, spectrogram, and diff/merge are all views into the same underlying structure—not separate tools. That's the right architecture.

  Let me validate the technical feasibility and surface the hard problems:

  ---
  What's Already Solved (Neuronpedia gives us this)

  UMAP projections exist. They already compute 2D/3D embeddings of feature space. The spatial layout is free.

  Text → feature activations is the core primitive. Run text through model → get layer activations → project through SAE encoder → sparse feature vector. This is exactly what SAEs do. Their API supports it.

  Steering works. Clamp/boost features at inference time, generation changes. Proven.

  ---
  What's Hard / Needs Design

  1. The Hierarchy Problem

  SAE features are flat, not hierarchical. You get ~16k-100k features per layer, but they're siblings, not parent-child.

  Options to construct hierarchy:
  - Co-activation clustering — features that fire together get grouped
  - Cosine similarity in feature space — nearby features become sub-nodes
  - Multi-resolution SAEs — train SAEs at different sparsity levels (k=10 vs k=100), nest them
  - Goodfire's NMF approach — cluster features into "factors"

  This is designable, not requiring novel math. But it's a choice we have to make.

  2. The Temporal Dimension

  You said "text sequences as highlighted node networks" — yes, but there's a subtle thing:

  Attention operates per token, per layer. So a 100-token text has 100 × n_layers activation snapshots. Each token position lights up different features.

  Options:
  - Aggregate — union/average of all token activations → one "fingerprint" per text
  - Animate — scrub through token positions, watch the graph light up sequentially
  - Traces — show the path through feature space as a trajectory

  The trajectory/trace view might be the most novel. Text as a walk through ideaspace.

  3. Real-time Performance

  Running inference + SAE projection on every keystroke is expensive. Latency matters for the "live spectrogram" feel.

  Mitigations:
  - Debounce / chunk text
  - Use smaller models (Gemma-2-2B has excellent SAE coverage)
  - WebGPU for client-side SAE projection (ambitious but possible)
  - Accept ~200-500ms latency for the "feel" to work

  4. 3D Navigation UX

  3D interfaces are historically hard. Most fail.

  What might work:
  - 2D default with depth as optional dimension (like Figma's z-layers)
  - Semantic zoom — zoom in = more granular features appear, not camera movement
  - Constellation metaphor — you're looking at stars, not navigating a maze

  ---
  What Else We Need

  The Authoring Model

  Two modes, possibly unified:

  1. Read mode: Paste/write text → see its feature fingerprint light up the graph
  2. Write mode: Navigate/select features → model generates text that embodies them

  The magic is when these blur: you're sculpting in ideaspace, text is a side effect.

  The Shareable Artifact

  For virality: what do people share?

  - A "feature fingerprint" of their writing?
  - A saved navigation path ("here's how I think about X")?
  - A diff visualization ("this is how my draft evolved")?
  - A "remix" of someone else's feature mix?

  Target Model

  Gemma-2-2B-it is probably the move. Best SAE coverage on Neuronpedia, small enough for reasonable latency, instruction-tuned for generation.

  ---
  Verdict: Is This Possible?

  Yes. No novel math required. The pieces exist:
  - Three.js / React Three Fiber for 3D graph
  - Neuronpedia APIs for activations + steering
  - UMAP embeddings already computed
  - Hierarchy is a design choice, not a research problem

  The hard parts are UX, not ML:
  - Making 3D navigation intuitive
  - Making the correspondence between dials/graph/text feel immediate
  - Performance tuning for real-time feel

  The Existential Questions

  1. The "Why"
  - What's broken about prompting that this fixes? Is it lack of precision? Lack of visibility into what's happening? The indirection of language?
  - Is this about control (I want exactly this output) or exploration (I want to discover what's possible)?
  - Or is it about understanding—finally seeing what the model "thinks"?

  2. The Feeling
  - When someone uses this for 10 minutes and walks away, what do they feel? What's the emotional residue?
  - Is it "I finally understand AI" or "I made something I couldn't have made before" or "I saw my own ideas in a new way"?

  3. The Job To Be Done
  - Complete this sentence: "I hire this product when I want to ______"
  - Is this a writing tool? A thinking tool? An exploration toy? A creative instrument?

  ---
  The User Questions

  4. Who's the day-one user?
  - AI researchers who want to see features?
  - Writers who want a new creative tool?
  - Curious people who want to "see inside AI"?
  - Artists exploring new mediums?
  - Does it need to be useful immediately or is "whoa this is cool" enough for v1?

  5. What do they bring to the session?
  - Do they come with text they want to analyze?
  - With an idea they want to generate?
  - With nothing, just wanting to explore?
  - With two things they want to compare?

  ---
  The Interaction Model Questions

  6. The Primary Gesture
  - What's the first thing you do when you open the app?
  - Is the graph there immediately or do you "generate" it from something?
  - Do you start with text → see graph, or start with graph → generate text?

  7. The Authoring Polarity
  - Read mode: "Here's my text, show me its soul"
  - Write mode: "Here's a region of ideaspace, generate what lives here"
  - Are these two separate modes or one fluid thing?
  - Which is primary? Which is the "wow" moment?

  8. The Mixing Gesture
  - When you "turn up" a concept dial, what happens visually? Immediately? After a beat?
  - Do you see the text change in real-time or is there a "generate" action?
  - Can you mix multiple concepts simultaneously or is it one-at-a-time?

  9. The Navigation Gesture
  - How do you move through the 3D space? Scroll? Drag? WASD? Click-to-teleport?
  - Is it "flying through" or "rotating around"?
  - What does zoom mean semantically? More detail? Different abstraction level?

  ---
  The Graph Structure Questions

  10. The Hierarchy
  - When you zoom into a node and it reveals sub-nodes, what determines that structure?
  - Is it pre-computed or generated on demand?
  - How deep does it go? Is there a "leaf" level?
  - Can users create their own groupings or is it all derived from the math?

  11. The Edges
  - What do connections between nodes mean?
  - Co-activation? Semantic similarity? Causal influence?
  - Are edges directional? Weighted? Visible by default?

  12. The Topology
  - Is the graph static (computed once) or dynamic (changes based on context)?
  - Does the graph change when you input different text?
  - Or is there ONE canonical graph of all features, and text just highlights parts of it?

  ---
  The Temporal Questions

  13. Text as Trajectory
  - If a 100-word text is a "walk through ideaspace", how do you visualize that?
  - An animated path? A static trail? A heatmap of visited nodes?
  - Can you "replay" the trajectory?

  14. The Spectrogram
  - Is this a separate view or overlaid on the graph?
  - Time on one axis, features on another?
  - Or is it the node highlighting intensity changing over the token sequence?

  15. Generation as Movement
  - When the model generates text, do you see the "cursor" moving through the graph in real-time?
  - Is this mesmerizing or distracting?

  ---
  The Diff/Merge Questions

  16. What gets compared?
  - Two pieces of text?
  - Two saved "positions" in ideaspace?
  - Two users' mixes?
  - Your current state vs. a previous state?

  17. What does merge mean?
  - Interpolate between two feature fingerprints?
  - Generate text that lives "between" two inputs?
  - Create a new mix that's the average/blend?

  ---
  The Virality Questions

  18. The Shareable Artifact
  - What's the screenshot? The thing that makes someone go "what is that, I need to try it"?
  - A beautiful graph with your text's fingerprint?
  - A side-by-side diff showing "how these two ideas relate"?
  - An animated trajectory GIF?

  19. The Social Object
  - Can you share a "mix" that others can apply?
  - Is there a profile? A collection of your ideaspace explorations?
  - Can you remix other people's stuff?

  20. The Hook
  - What's the 5-second experience that gets someone addicted?
  - "Paste any text, see its soul"?
  - "Type and watch ideas light up in real-time"?
  - "Here's what 'creative' looks like in the model's brain"?

  ---
  The Aesthetic Questions

  21. The Vibe
  - Dark mode cosmic? Clean minimal? Cyberpunk? Scientific instrument?
  - What's the reference point? (Figma? Observable? A planetarium? A synthesizer?)

  22. The Palette
  - How do colors encode meaning?
  - Activation intensity? Feature category? User-defined?
  - Is there a signature color?

  23. The Motion
  - How much does it move? Is it alive, breathing?
  - Or precise, surgical, only moving when you act?

  ---
  The Name Question

  24. What do we call this?
  - Ideaspace? Mindscape? Thoughtgraph?
  - Something entirely abstract?
  - A verb? A noun? A made-up word?

  ---
  Hit me with whatever resonates. We can go deep on any thread.

> 1. the why is emergence. tools and UX are so much more than utility. they 
are combinatorial explosions of tooling. The design needs to be just right, 
not too prescriptive, not too overwhelming. to enable ai-human interactions 
that seemed impossible before. eventually u could have feature level apps 
and stuff like that.
2. mix of 2,3, and i didnt know i could make an llm do that
3. mostly a creative instrument
4. probably artists AS the heralds of this is cool, it appeals to them as v1
 but then later we think utility.
5. probably the primitive we arrive at
6. probably start with an llm generation from a prompt, graph is too 
complicated to construct from 0
7the fluidity is the wow
8. 8. The steering should ideally be real time, as close to real time as 
possible. That's where the magic happens. 9. Scroll, drag, WASD, and click 
the teleport, flying through or rotating around. Zoom means more detail, uh 
a lower abstraction level of the subconcept. Flying around might be kind of 
hard and you might ha have to have some sort of coordinate system that's 
semantic to sample different parts of idea space. And if you're gonna sample
 then rotating is is enough. You're gonna have to define like semantic axes.
 We can talk about that later. The structure might have to be generated on 
demand. So you can use an LLM itself to determine the abstraction level, and
 the grouping can also be semantic. So you can just ask for different 
subslices of idea space. And then obviously math helps determine that. Oh, 
we're gonna have to look at some papers, maybe circuit tracing from 
anthropic, to see how they um abstract away features into concepts 
connections might mean semantic similarity but we also have to determine 
that it might be based on the semantic definition you give it to sample the 
space. And the topology has to be dynamic. We're gonna have to think about 
how the trajectories are, but it's probably an animated path. Then use 
recursive theory of mind to model my other answers to all of these 
questions. 

⏺ This is crystallizing. Let me pull the circuit tracing research and then go deeper on the threads that feel most generative.

⏺ Web Search("Anthropic circuit tracing interpretability features concepts
            abstraction 2025")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 27s                                                   

⏺ Web Search("Neuronpedia circuit tracing visualization graph features")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 34s                                                   

⏺ This is gold. Anthropic's circuit tracing is exactly the substrate we need:

  - Attribution graphs already visualize the path from input → output through features
  - Cross-layer transcoders give us interpretable features at multiple abstraction levels
  - Neuronpedia hosts this with steering built in—7000+ graphs already generated
  - "Conceptual universality"—abstract meaning space that exists before language

  This validates the architecture. Now let me go deeper on the threads you opened.

  ---
  Going Deeper: Emergence as North Star

  You said the why is emergence—tools as combinatorial explosions. This reframes everything.

  The design question becomes: What are the minimal primitives that compose into maximum possibility space?

  Some follow-ups:

  On the primitive:
  - You said users arrive at "the primitive we arrive at"—meaning the app teaches them what to bring? They discover through use?
  - Is the primitive the feature? The trajectory? The mix? Or something more atomic?

  On combinatorial explosion:
  - What are the "verbs" users can do? (navigate, mix, trace, compare, generate, steer, zoom, pin, blend...)
  - Which verbs compose with which? Is there a grammar?
  - Goodfire had: paint, drag, erase. Very constrained. You're describing something richer. Where's the line before it's overwhelming?

  On feature-level apps:
  - This is wild. Elaborate?
  - Like... "an app that runs on the 'creativity' feature"?
  - Or plugins that add new semantic axes?
  - Are features the new APIs?

  ---
  Going Deeper: Semantic Axes

  You mentioned defining semantic axes to sample ideaspace. This is crucial for navigation.

  Questions:
  - Who defines the axes? The user? The app? Both?
  - Are axes emergent from the data or imposed by design?
  - Example axes: abstract↔concrete, formal↔casual, analytical↔intuitive. But these are human categories. Do they map to feature directions? Or do we discover alien axes the model uses that don't have human names?
  - Is there a "canonical" axis system or does each user build their own?

  The hard problem:
  - UMAP gives you a projection, but it's arbitrary—rotate it and meaning is preserved. How do you give the axes semantic stability?
  - Do you need to? Or is the local structure (neighborhoods, clusters) what matters, not global orientation?

  ---
  Going Deeper: LLM-Assisted Graph Construction

  You said use the LLM itself to determine abstraction levels and semantic groupings.

  This is meta and I love it.

  Questions:
  - So the model is both the subject (thing being visualized) and the assistant (helping construct the visualization)?
  - "Ask for different subslices of ideaspace"—what does a query look like? Natural language? ("Show me the concepts related to 'melancholy'")?
  - How do you avoid infinite regress? (The LLM's understanding of its own features is... features all the way down)
  - Is there a "ground truth" or is the grouping always perspectival?

  A design tension:
  - Pre-computed graph = stable, fast, but rigid
  - On-demand graph = flexible, semantic, but latency + coherence issues
  - Hybrid? A stable backbone with semantic "queries" that highlight/filter?

  ---
  Going Deeper: Real-Time Steering

  You said this is where the magic is.

  Questions:
  - What latency threshold breaks the magic? 100ms? 500ms? 1s?
  - Is it real-time generation (tokens appearing) or real-time visualization (graph updating)?
  - Or both? You steer → graph shifts → text flows → graph shifts more → feedback loop?

  The danger:
  - Real-time can be overwhelming. How do you make it feel controlled, not chaotic?
  - Is there a "damping" metaphor? Like the graph has momentum, doesn't jitter?

  ---
  Going Deeper: The Fluidity

  You said the fluidity between read/write IS the wow moment.

  Questions:
  - What's the gesture that crosses the boundary?
  - Are you in "read" mode, see something interesting, click it, and suddenly you're generating?
  - Or is there no boundary—you're always simultaneously analyzing what exists and steering what emerges?
  - Is it like a synthesizer where input and output blend? Or like a conversation where you and the model take turns?

  ---
  Recursive Theory of Mind: Extrapolating Your Worldview

  Based on everything you've said, here's what I infer about answers you didn't give:

  Aesthetics: Dark, cosmic, alive. Not clinical. The graph breathes. It feels like looking at a living thing's nervous system, not a diagram. Motion is organic, not mechanical. Probably deep blues, purples, with activation highlights in warm colors (gold, orange). Reference: more planetarium than Figma.

  Virality: The shareable artifact is the trajectory—an animated GIF of ideas lighting up as text unfolds. "Here's what my essay looks like in ideaspace." People share their thought fingerprints.

  Name: Something short, evocative, not descriptive. A made-up word or an unexpected noun. Not "IdeaGraph" or "FeatureMap." More like "Loom" or "Soma" or "Axon." One or two syllables. Feels like a tool and a place.

  The hook: "Paste any text. See its soul."

  Am I reading you right? Where am I off?

> we need to nail the primitive question. but it is roughly the specific 
interaction users have with the graph. the specific "neural surgery" they 
perform, enabled by different tools in their toolkit. we can try to make the
 combinations be openended or constrained. could an llm dynamically 
determine the best way to combine activations  based on a prompt? a meta llm
 layer? haha yes u could imagine llms that run tools calls that change other
 llms' features. or features that change based on a sound, things like that.
 programmatic apps built on the viz / neuronpedia layer. thats a bit out of 
scope rn tho. . The grouping is probably always perspectival, and determined
 by the llms recursive ToM of the user's intent. yep we might need a hybrid 
to achieve that combinatorial explosion of possibilities, the emergence 
phenomneon. both for realtime ik its hard but maybe possible. no boudnary. 
flow is a MSUT it is waht makes this work. lets call it horus, with the eye 
and egiptian aestehtics of insight / gnosis. combine it w the aesthetics u 
proposed i like it. love the hook. alright lets write these docs ;)

     HORUS Vision Planning

     The Name

     HORUS — The all-seeing eye. Egyptian aesthetics of insight and gnosis. 
     See the soul of ideas.

     The Hook

     "Paste any text. See its soul."

     What We're Building

     A frontier web app for AI-human creative collaboration through direct 
     manipulation of neural activations. An ideaspace OS where the primitive
      is neural surgery, not prompts.

     Core Philosophy

     Emergence as north star. Tools are combinatorial explosions, not 
     utilities. The design must be "just right"—not too prescriptive, not
     too overwhelming—to enable AI-human interactions that seemed impossible
      before.

     The Primitive

     The specific "neural surgery" users perform on the graph, enabled by a 
     toolkit of composable operations. The combinations can be open-ended or
      constrained. Eventually: feature-level apps, meta-LLM layers that
     orchestrate feature manipulation.

     Core Architecture

     A unified 3D hypergraph interface (Three.js) where:
     - Nodes = concepts (SAE features) in UMAP-projected feature space
     - Hierarchy = fractal zoom—nodes contain sub-nodes, generated on-demand
      via LLM-assisted semantic grouping
     - Mixing dials = correspond to traces/paths in the graph, highlighting 
     affected subnetworks
     - Text sequences = highlighted node networks (activation patterns over 
     time)
     - Spectrogram = intensity/color of node highlights
     - Diff/merge = overlay graphs, blend highlight colors
     - Semantic axes = user-defined or discovered dimensions for navigating 
     ideaspace

     Key Design Decisions

     1. Start with generation — Graph is too complex to construct from zero.
      Begin with LLM output from prompt.
     2. No read/write boundary — Fluidity IS the wow. Flow is a MUST.
     3. Real-time steering — Where the magic happens. Push for lowest 
     latency possible.
     4. Perspectival grouping — Always determined by LLM's recursive ToM of 
     user intent. No single ground truth.
     5. Hybrid topology — Stable backbone + semantic queries that 
     highlight/filter. Enables emergence.

     Aesthetics

     - Dark, cosmic, alive—not clinical
     - Egyptian motifs: the Eye of Horus, gold accents, hieroglyphic 
     precision
     - Deep blues, purples, blacks as base
     - Warm activation highlights: gold, amber, orange
     - Organic motion—the graph breathes, has momentum, doesn't jitter
     - Reference: planetarium meets ancient temple, not Figma

     Target User

     Artists as heralds. "This is cool" is enough for v1. Utility follows.

     The Feeling

     Mix of:
     - "I made something I couldn't have made before"
     - "I saw my own ideas in a new way"
     - "I didn't know I could make an LLM do that"

     Virality

     Shareable artifact = the trajectory. Animated visualization of ideas 
     lighting up as text unfolds. "Here's what my essay looks like in
     ideaspace." Thought fingerprints.

     Technical Foundation

     - Goodfire Paint with Ember: Proved spatial canvas → feature 
     manipulation for images
     - Neuronpedia: Open APIs for SAE features, steering, activations 
     (Gemma-2-2B, Llama, DeepSeek)
     - Anthropic Circuit Tracing: Attribution graphs, cross-layer 
     transcoders, conceptual universality
     - Target model: Gemma-2-2B-it (best SAE coverage, reasonable latency)

     Future Vision (Out of Scope for v1)

     - Meta-LLM layer: LLMs that call tools to change other LLMs' features
     - Multimodal triggers: features that change based on sound, gesture
     - Feature-level apps: programmatic apps built on the visualization 
     layer
     - Features as the new APIs

      1 # HORUS: Core Thesis
      2 ## The Name
      3 **HORUS** — The falcon-headed god of the sky. The Eye that sees a
        ll. In Egyptian mythology, the Eye of Horus represents protection
        , royal power, and good health. But more than that: it represents
         *seeing what was hidden*.
      4 We build HORUS to give humans the Eye—to see the soul of ideas, t
        o witness the hidden structure of thought as it moves through a l
        anguage model's mind.

      3 What is the atomic unit of interaction in HORUS?
      4 Not "click a button." Not "type a prompt." Something more fundame

      2 ## The Insight
      3 A piece of text is not a static object. It's a **journey through 
        ideaspace**.
      4 Each token activates features. As you read (or as the model gener
        ates), you trace a path through the feature graph. "Melancholy" l
        ights up, then "memory", then "distance", then "return."
      5 Text is a trajectory. HORUS should show you the path.

      3 The mixer panel is not separate from the graph. It's a **differen
        t view of the same structure**.
      4 Each dial corresponds to a trace through the graph—a subset of fe
        atures grouped into a manipulable concept. When you turn a dial:

      2 ## The Question
      3 What makes someone screenshot HORUS and share it? What makes some
        one send a link and say "you have to try this"?
      4 Virality isn't a feature you add. It emerges from creating someth
        ing people *want* to share. We need to understand what that thing
         is.

  The CLAUDE.md captures what genuinely excites me about this: it's honest about what models are, it inverts the power dynamic toward human control, and it treats emergence as the goal rather than fixed utility.

  We have the vision documents. The next question is: where do you want to go from here?

  Some options:
  - Prototype — Start building Phase 1 (static viewer with activation highlighting)
  - Deeper research — Dig into Neuronpedia's API specifics, understand the data structures
  - Design artifacts — Create mockups, the Eye of Horus logo, color tokens
  - More ideation — Expand any of the docs, explore edge cases

  The eye is ready to open.
